# 🚀 Payten Hackathon 2024 – Car Wash Management & Loyalty System  

## 🏆 About the Hackathon  
The **Payten Hackathon 2024** challenged teams to develop an innovative solution for unattended payment terminals. Our team, **WindowsXP**, built a **Car Wash Management & Loyalty System** to modernize self-service car wash stations.

We developed **two Kotlin-based Android applications**:  
1. **Loyalty App** – Allows users to scan a QR code at a terminal, collect and use bonus points, manage their balance, and locate nearby car wash stations.  
2. **Terminal App** – Installed on the unattended terminal, enabling users to scan QR codes, buy or redeem tokens, and start the car wash process.

## 🔥 Problem Statement  
Car wash stations often face challenges such as:  
- **Lack of small change** – Users struggle to pay for car washes.  
- **Unused tokens** – Customers forget where they got them, leading to waste.  
- **Long queues** – Stations get overcrowded during peak hours.  
- **Security risks** – Cash-based stations are prone to theft.  

## 💡 Our Solution  
We built a **cashless, smart car wash system** that:  
✅ Uses **virtual tokens** instead of physical ones.  
✅ Enables **loyalty rewards** by converting unused time into bonus points.
